## Development and Storybook

You can easily develop and interact with your components by using Storybook. To run the local server, simply run:

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run storybook
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) to view your stories. They should automatically update as you develop.

Storybook will pick up any story from the `stories.js` file in a component folder.
